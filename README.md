## ios-nytimes-mostpopular

A simple iOS Native app developed in Swift to hit the The NY Times Most Popular Articles (Most Viewed) API and show a list of articles, that shows details when items on the list are tapped (a typical master/detail app).

## Demonstrations

Covers the following:
* Object Oriented Programming Approach 
* Unit Tests 
* Generic and simple code 
* Leverage today's best coding practices ([See Disclaimer](#disclaimer))

App Features:
* Supports Split View (Landscape orientation)
* Auto layout with Dynamic Cell Resizing
* Supports API Pagination 
* Dynamic Time Period Configuration 
* Dynamic Section Configuration 

## Installation

Pods are made available as part of repository, to facilitate simplicity in checkout and execution. Simply checkout and run the project.

## Build

To build using xcodebuild without code signing
```
xcodebuild clean build -workspace "NYTimes_MostPopularArticles.xcworkspace" -scheme "NYTimes_MostPopularArticles" CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO
```


## Tests

To run tests using xcodebuild.
```
xcodebuild -workspace "NYTimes_MostPopularArticles.xcworkspace" -scheme "NYTimes_MostPopularArticles" -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 7 Plus,OS=10.3' test
```

### Disclaimer

Although code quality can be subjective at times, and the approaches may not entirely be the best, I'll be happy to ([answer any questions](#contact)) related to existing implementations as well as acknowledged areas which can potentially be further improved.

## General Notes/FAQ's

* Why a protocol for Network Controller?
This keeps the Structure flexible and independent of the networking SDK used. I used Alamofire in this example, however the structure is flexible enough to accomodate any other framework or custom classes.

* Why base64encoded the api-key?
To keep the implementation simple, not recommended for production usages (Best to keep the api key on a server proxy, or use encryption if at all it has to be kept in the code), hard-coding the api-key in plain text inside the code should be avoided at any cost.

* Why some classes have static methods but are not Singletons?
None of the classes in the current scope are maintaining any stateful functionality at the moment. (Although a session like state can be maintained for current offset etc under a single class, but with a 2-page application, viewcontroller handling this is simplest) Unless a class needs to maintains a state, using singleton only for static methods should be avoided.

* What areas are potentially improvable, or to be updated in future? -- Unit Tests, current coverage is basic with minimum scenarios, this could be reflected more. Web service response stubs could be utilised for parsing tests etc. -- Config Manager can be further extended to support multiple environments and url configurations, for example QA, Production etc. -- Appearance could be further implemented in a more flexible way to plug and play multiple themes.
